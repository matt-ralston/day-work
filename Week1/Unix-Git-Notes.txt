We've learned the history of Unix.


The Unix Way has 4 principles:

1. Data as plaintext files

2. Nested subdirectories. good structure and organization

3. Many small programs  - and should do one specific thing well. if you have  it do one specific task well, there should be less surprises/problems arise

4. Input-output redirection. the OS should always be able to take info from an input mechanism and display in output (screen mostly).


Common Commands:
pwd - what user youâ€™re on
cd - change directory
ls - list subdirectories
mkdir - create directory
touch - create file
