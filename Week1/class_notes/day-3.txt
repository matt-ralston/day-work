Day 3 notes

for loop has 3 parts:


variable
property has a value
array - list
function
object


=== Will not

What can we store in a var (variable)?
  Some data types are provided by the programming language:
    primitive types: integers, floats, characters, Booleans
    complex types: strings, arrays, key-value pairs
      complex type is usually made of of primitive types of some type.

  Data types allow us to store and manipulate values with operations

  Integers use + to mean addition: 5 + 2 : 7
  Strings use +to mean concatenations: "5" + "2" : 52


Sublime : in CSS type out attribute: then type "control spacebar" and a box will open showing all options.
