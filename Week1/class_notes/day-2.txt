Required Structure for HTML
  - DOCTYPE: instructs the browser the type of doc to display
  - html
  - head outlines any meta data the doc title and links to external files. outside of <title>, no tags are visible within the web page in the browser to the user.
  - body: all of the content visible on the webpage


Where to put JS file in HTML doc:
  When a file is referenced in the <HEAD> the browser immediately processes everything. Browser executes and retrieves everything before looking at body. Then browser gets to body and goes through the body in order from top to bottom. Good practice is to put JS in <head> or at that very bottom of body just before the closing </body> tag.


  DOM - Document-Object Model: a cross platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML, XHMTL, and XML documents. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree, with the topmost node referred to as 'the document'
  Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse into a DOM.
  Layout engines:
  Trident/MSHTML - used by IE
  Gecko - Mozilla Firefox
  Webkit - Safari/iOS
  Blink - Chrome and Opera
